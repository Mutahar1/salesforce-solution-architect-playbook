# Salesforce Solution Architect Playbook
### Build • Automate • Integrate • Govern

Production-grade Salesforce patterns covering **custom development, automation, integrations, and enterprise governance**.

This repository represents how Salesforce is built in **real organizations** with multiple teams, complex security, integrations, and long-term scalability in mind.

---

## Overview

This project showcases hands-on Salesforce experience across:

- Custom development (Apex, LWC, Aura, Visualforce)
- Declarative & programmatic automation
- API-based integrations and async processing
- Security, access control, and data governance
- Release management and operational readiness

Built with an **architect mindset**, not tutorial shortcuts.

---

## The Problems

- Automation sprawl with no clear strategy
- Fragile triggers and unscalable Flows
- UI components that break at scale
- Poorly handled integrations
- Data quality and access issues
- No clear release or deployment process

---

## The Solution 

- Declarative-first where it makes sense
- Apex only when it adds real value
- Bulk safe, secure, and testable code
- Modular UI components
- Integration patterns with proper error handling
- Governance baked into design

---

## Technical Implemetation

### Custom Development
- Apex classes, triggers, and test frameworks
- Lightning Web Components with clean UX
- Aura components and Visualforce (including PDFs)
- Classic → Lightning migration patterns

### Automation & Async Processing
- Record-triggered and scheduled Flows
- Approval processes and validations
- Queueable, Batch, Future, Scheduled Apex
- Error handling and retries

### Integrations
- REST & SOAP APIs
- Webhooks and platform events
- External services & middleware patterns
- Secure authentication handling

### Security & Governance
- Profiles, permission sets, role hierarchy
- Sharing rules & OWD configuration
- Field-level security enforcement
- Data access governance
